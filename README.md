## Building

Run `docc preview TSPL.docc`
in this repository's root directory.

After running DocC, open the link that `docc` outputs
to display a local preview in your browser.

> Note:
>
> If you installed DocC by downloading a toolchain from Swift.org,
> `docc` is located in `usr/bin/`,
> relative to the installation path of the toolchain.
> Make sure your shell's `PATH` environment variable
> includes that directory.
>
> If you installed DocC by downloading Xcode,
> run `xcrun docc preview TSPL.docc` instead.
